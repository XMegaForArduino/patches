This is the root 'project' directory for the WinAVR update.

Generally, this should not be attempted unless you know what you are doing.
Because the build requires 'make install', you will need to make sure you
have write privileges on the /usr/local directory (where installed files will
end up).  It is necessary to INSTALL avr-binutils, then avr-gcc, in order to
build the 'avr-libc' tree, and in that order.

If you want to build yourself, you will need to fetch the following files
and put them here:

  binutils-2.24.tar.bz2
  gcc-4.8.3.tar.bz2
  avr-libc-1.8.1.tar.bz2
  avrdude-6.1.tar.gz


These files can (currently) be obtained from:

  http://mirrors.kernel.org/sources.redhat.com/binutils/releases/binutils-2.24.tar.bz2

  http://mirrors.kernel.org/sources.redhat.com/gcc/releases/gcc-4.8.3/gcc-4.8.3.tar.bz2

  http://nongnu.askapache.com/avr-libc/avr-libc-1.8.1.tar.bz2

  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/avrdude/avrdude-6.1.tar.gz


Then, run 'megamake.sh' under cygwin, from this directory.  It should apply
patches and then build/install everything into /usr/local .

(from there you can copy files into the installer tree, TBD)



REQUIRED CYGWIN PACKAGES
-------------------------

A few packages are absolutely necessary to successfully build everything.
If they are missing, you'll typically get 'configure' script errors.

I do NOT have a proper list.  However, I can at least include a list of the
packages I currently have installed that resulted in a successful build.
These were saved in cygwin.pkglist.txt .

also, I specifically remember THESE packages needed to be installed:

autoconf
automake
bison
gettext
expect
flex
gamin
gmp
isl
libCLooG
libusb0
libusb1.0
tcl
tcl-tk
texinfo
xz

You must include the '-devel' versions, which will have the correct header
files and libraries installed in the right places.  OK I agree that Cygwin's
package manager is a bit kludgy, but if you use the filtering feature you
can do it 'somewhat easily'.

I will update this short-list as I verify needed packages.  It is by no means
a complete list, nor is it ALL necessarily required for success.  It is what
I remember 'trial installing' to get the build to work.


FYI the program that generates the package list is 'cygwin.pkglist.sh'.  I
noticed a few packages aren't there for some reason.  So it's not perfect.
