This directory contains patch and license-related files for the 'gcc'
project, provided by the 'XMega For Arduino' project, intended to be built
under an environment such as Cygwin (http://cygwin.com/).

The 'gcc' project is licensed under the [L]GPLv3, with a 'runtime license
exception' for binaries compiled under the license terms. In general
this means that the source must be made available if you distribute gcc in
binary form, but you can compile your own project with gcc and not have it
fall under the GPLv3 requirements.

The license text is in the following files:
  COPYING            GPLv2
  COPYING.LIB        LGPLv2
  COPYING3           GPLv3
  COPYING3.LIB       LGPLv3
  COPYING.RUNTIME    Run-time exception for GPLv3

Also, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ for more information.

The source for 'gcc' can be obtained here:

The patch files for this source are in 'files'.

The text of the original 'README' has been included here, for reference.

This directory contains the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

The GNU Compiler Collection is free software.  See the files whose
names start with COPYING for copying permission.  The manuals, and
some of the runtime libraries, are under different terms; see the
individual source files for details.

The directory INSTALL contains copies of the installation information
as HTML and plain text.  The source of this information is
gcc/doc/install.texi.  The installation information includes details
of what is included in the GCC sources and what files GCC installs.

See the file gcc/doc/gcc.texi (together with other files that it
includes) for usage and porting information.  An online readable
version of the manual is in the files gcc/doc/gcc.info*.

See http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/ for how to report bugs usefully.

Copyright years on GCC source files may be listed using range
notation, e.g., 1987-2012, indicating that every year in the range,
inclusive, is a copyrightable year that could otherwise be listed
individually.
